### 🚀 Looking for Something New

Hey there 👋 It’s been a while, so here’s a quick update.

👨‍💻 I’m currently working at **NIQ (formerly GfK SE)** as a **Senior Frontend Software Engineer**. I spend my days building internal tools for data power users, leading frontend efforts across domains, and maintaining a custom design system. I’m also responsible for parts of our CI/CD pipeline (GitLab) and manage our Kubernetes-based deployments.

It’s been a great experience—especially in terms of scaling architecture, working across teams, and pushing accessibility forward.

### ❗ Why I’m Looking for a New Opportunity

NIQ is undergoing a global restructuring and has decided to follow a **hubbing strategy**, consolidating engineering operations into a few international locations (specifically outside of Germany—mainly India).

As part of this shift, many engineering roles—including mine—are being sunset. I’ve been asked to prepare for offboarding.

While it’s never easy, I’m choosing to see this as an opportunity: to find a new role where I can bring my experience, energy, and technical focus to a team that values thoughtful engineering and user-centered development.

### 📬 Availability

I’ll officially be available starting **September 15, 2025**, but I’m happy to start conversations sooner.

If you’re hiring—or know someone who is—feel free to reach out here on LinkedIn or via 📧 [cv@phhbr.de](mailto:cv@phhbr.de). I’d love to hear about teams that value clean architecture, accessibility, and delivering excellent user experiences.

Thanks for reading!

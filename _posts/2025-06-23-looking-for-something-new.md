#### Looking for Something New

hey there. it’s been a while again, so time for a proper update.

jobwise, i’m currently working at **NIQ (formerly GfK SE)** as a **Senior Frontend Software Engineer**. my day-to-day work involves developing internal products for data power users, leading frontend efforts across teams, and maintaining a custom design system that we use across domains. i also handle parts of our CI/CD process via gitlab and manage k8s deployments. 

i’ve learned a lot here – especially in terms of large-scale architecture, accessibility, and working with distributed teams – but unfortunately, the company is now undergoing a strategic shift.

#### why i'm looking for a new position

NIQ is in the process of restructuring globally and has decided to follow a *hubbing* strategy, which means consolidating engineering efforts into a few central locations (outside of germany, india to be precise). as a result, many roles – including mine – are being phased out. i’ve been asked to prepare for offboarding, and while that’s obviously not ideal, i see this as a chance to look ahead and find a new challenge where i can make an impact.

so if you’re reading this and you're hiring for frontend engineers – or know someone who is – feel free to reach out.

#### availability

i’ll officially be available starting **September 15th 2025**, but i'm happy to start conversations earlier.

as always, i’m reachable via [cv@phhbr.de](mailto:cv@phhbr.de) or [linkedin.com/in/phhbr](https://linkedin.com/in/phhbr). i’d be excited to contribute to a team that values clean architecture, accessibility, and great user experiences.

### 👋 Leaving LinkedIn, Staying Available

After several years of active use, I’ve decided to delete my LinkedIn profile and stop using the platform.  

This is a personal and principled decision that reflects how I currently see the value and direction of the platform.

***

### 🧭 Why I’m Leaving

For a long time, LinkedIn was useful for professional networking, sharing knowledge, and discovering new opportunities.  

Over time, however, the benefit it provides to my work and my connections no longer justifies the effort and the constraints that come with using the platform.

***

### 📬 How to Reach Me

Even without LinkedIn, I remain just as reachable for clients, collaborators, and new contacts as before.  

If you’d like to work with me or simply stay in touch, please reach out directly via:

- 📧 Email: **[freelance@phhbr.de](mailto:freelance@phhbr.de)**
- ☎️ Phone: **[+49 1512 61 66 279]**
- 💻 Code & projects: **[GitHub](https://github.com/phhbr)**

***

### 🤝 Still Open for Projects

This change does not affect my availability for interesting software engineering, frontend, or design system projects.  

Instead of going through a social network, communication and collaboration will simply continue through more direct channels like email & phone.
